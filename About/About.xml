	Ever wanted to run your cannibal colony more ethically? 
	Tired of having to hunt down humans to get your meat and leather?
	Want to run a literal human leather cowboy hat farm?
	Well do i have the mod for you!

	This mod adds flesh plants that drop human meat and human leather.

	They are available by default, and require 0 skill to sow.

	The meat plant takes 6 days to grow, and yield 2 meat each.

	The leather plants take 8 days to grow, and yield 4 leather each.

	how do they work??? ehhh, genetic manipulation done by some crazy glitter-tech scientist maybe? who knows.


	note:
	This is my first mod, yay!!! 
	Thanks to the people of the Rimworld discord for help in learning how to make it,
	And thanks to the vanilla plants expanded mod, which I ripped apart and learned a lot from.
